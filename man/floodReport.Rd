  report_name,
  image_path = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{report_name}{The name of the report you wish to generate. One of "Dawson", "Whitehorse", "Carmacks", "Ross River". Leave as default NULL if specifying a parameter under custom_report_stations.}

\item{image_path}{The path to the directory (folder) containing the images you wish to include. Default to NULL to not include any images. Set to "choose" to navigate to the folder, or enter the folder path directly as a character string. Some reports automatically include web-hosted images, these should not be included here.}

\item{save_path}{The path to the directory (folder) where the report should be saved. Default ("choose" )}

\item{hydat_creds}{The login credentials you wish to use for hydat. Defaults to your .Renviron file (so you can set and forget on a particular machine) but can also be specified as a character vector of two (as in c("username", "password")).}

\item{custom_report_stations}{A user-specified list of stations for which to generate a report. Defaults to NULL to operate on the report_name parameter instead. Input must be a character vector of all station IDs. Reminder: you can create a character vector from a column of a data.frame, and you can reference an environment object instead of typing in the vector!}

floodReport(
  report_name = NULL,
  custom_report_stations = NULL,
  report_type = "Both",
  level_zoom = FALSE,
  zoom_days = 30,
  image_path = NULL,
  save_path = "choose"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{report_name}{The name of the report you wish to generate. One of "Dawson", "Whitehorse", "Carmacks", "Pelly", or "Old Crow". Leave as NULL (default) if specifying stations under custom_report_stations.}

\item{custom_report_stations}{A user-specified list of stations for which to generate a report. Defaults to NULL to operate on the report_name parameter instead. Input must be a character vector of station IDs, as in c("station1", "station2"). Reminder: you can create a character vector from a column of a data.frame, and you can reference an environment object instead of typing in the vector!}

\item{report_type}{What do you want your report to contain? Choose from "Level", "Flow", or "Both." Defaults to Both.}

\item{level_zoom}{Do you want a zoomed-in plot for level? Choose from TRUE or FALSE. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{zoom_days}{The number of days to plot for zoomed in level plots. Defaults to 40, but not used unless level_zoom is set to TRUE.}

\item{image_path}{The path to the directory (folder) containing the images you wish to include. Default to NULL to not include any images. Set to "choose" to navigate to the folder, or enter the folder path directly as a character string. Some reports automatically include web-hosted images, these should not be included here.}

\item{save_path}{The path to the directory (folder) where the report should be saved. Default "choose" lets you select your folder, otherwise enter the path as a character string.}
